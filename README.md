Draw is a wrapper around Excalidraw, integrated with Supabase to save and sync your drawings seamlessly across different devices. It allows you to use Excalidraw anywhere while keeping your data available everywhere.

## Features diff from fork

```diff
* Excalidraw: Leverages the functionality of Excalidraw, a popular web-based drawing tool.
* Cloud Sync: Uses Supabase for authentication and storage, ensuring secure access and synchronization of your drawings.
+ Folders: Organize drawings into folders.
+ Sidebar: Navigate and manage folders and drawings from a sleek sidebar.
- Clunky UI: Removed clunky, unnecessary ui components from the UI.
```

## Getting Started

### Usage

- **Sign Up or Log In:** Use the authentication flow provided by Supabase to sign up or log in.
